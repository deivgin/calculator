# calculator app

## [Live preview](https://upbeat-chandrasekhar-98354c.netlify.app/)

App whose purpose is to practice react and typescript

## Needs fixing:

- would be cool to combine all button types into one button and change it based on its type
- add minus functionality
- create favicon
- update readme after project is done (create a great looking readme that many projects have, add photos, features, etc.)
- when in smaller screen the height is too large
- PWA

## Making it better

- All the numbers that are used and aren't clear what they mean, should be in a const
- All of if checks should be in a const that is named on what it does
- Create a function that checks all the cases and formats the string
- For theming use Context to transfer and switch the state
- use clsx for combining classes
- In Screen component create a new component from the number div
- create a useCalculator hook and transfer all the calculation data to it
- Clean up the component folder structure, make it cleaner and with its own hooks, functions, models, etc.
- All the places where you need some time to remember what it does should be in properly named functions or variables or constants.
