# calculator app

## [Live preview](https://upbeat-chandrasekhar-98354c.netlify.app/)

App whose purpose is to practice react and typescript

## Needs fixing:

- would be cool to combine all button types into one button and change it based on its type
- add minus functionality
- create favicon
- update readme after project is done (create a great looking readme that many projects have, add photos, features, etc.)
- when in smaller screen the height is too large
- PWA

## To Do

- For theming use Context to transfer and switch the state
- In Screen component create a new component from the number div
- Clean up all the functions in useCalculator, they should be responsible only for one thing, if you can extract another function from it - do it.
- Clean up the component folder structure, make it cleaner and with its own hooks, functions, models, etc.
- Combine all the different buttons into one button element

## Remember

- All the numbers that are used and aren't clear what they mean, should be in a const
- All of if checks should be in a const that is named on what it does
- All the places where you need some time to remember what it does should be in properly named functions or variables or constants.
